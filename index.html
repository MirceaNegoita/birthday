After so many years after we both were thinking what if? I am so glad that you came into Galati that night, glad e underwhelming here. It was fun, extatic, our hearts with racing with love beats, nights fueled by passion, desire, moans and conversations about hopes, dreams, aspirations in life, laughter, wondering about what the future will be.</p>

I love that we can be lazy and just chill sometimes, doing nothing, just watching movies, it really feels like a break from all the busy routine and just some good old relaxation and being two sloths</p>

It made me realise that damn she can become in a second if I do not treat her right and I made a commitment that I will try to be better, I know we had our downfall and fights since then also but this was an eye opening experience for me, it made me not want to take you for granted and made me appreciate you being in my life more</p>
